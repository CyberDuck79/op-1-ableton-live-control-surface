LAST UPDATE - 22 April 2017
- OP1 can now control transport params of Ableton in "transport mode" (tape)
- shift + arrows jumps to next/previous marker
- lift button sets/unsets a marker
- shift+lift hides/shows the browser
- blue encoder scrubs the tape (even while playing)
- green encoder changes quantization parameters
- white encoder moves the play position and makes a selection while pressed
- orange encoder zooms arrangement view when in transport mode
- shift + play plays a selection (if there is one)
- shift + loop in sets the beggining of the loop to the current play position
- screen now displays play state, quantization and BPM

8 September 2014

- The main problems with the Live 9 version of the scripts were fixed.
- The red box appears again and the song position arrows work again but with a workaround as I still couldn't understand why set_seek_buttons of the TransportComponent aren't working.
